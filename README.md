This is a test usin gthe Kilo Code vscode extension to write a space invaders game.

The prompt was "Please write a simple space invaders game for the browser."

I think it did a pretty good job! I hadn't previously tried the "Agentic" AI extensions, so this was an interesting experiment. I used `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`. 

I have previously mostly used continue.dev with Qwen2.5-Coder 3B for autocomplete and various chat models, but surprisingly, the fully agentic AI actually works pretty well now.
